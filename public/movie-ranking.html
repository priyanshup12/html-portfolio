    <h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <p>The story is really good and characters very relatable.</p>

    <h3>Whiplash</h3>
    <p>
        The story shows struggle with which everyone can relate, 
        but at the same time the movie keeps things grounded i.e. it feels like real life.

    <h3>Tumbadd</h3>
    <p>The movie tries to present a simple idea and does it beautifully.</p>
